HDI = geometric mean of normalized indices for each dimension

Step 1. Creating the dimension indices

>Minimum and maximum values (goalposts) are SET
>Goalposts used to transform indicators into 0-1 indices
>Each indicator is calculated as (actual - max / max - min)
>Dimension index comes from arithmetic mean of above normalized indices

Step 2. Aggregate dimensions

> ( I_1 x ... I_n ) ** 1/n
